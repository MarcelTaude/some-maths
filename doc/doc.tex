\title{too old to demonstrate, to young to die}
\author{Marcel Taude}
\date{November 2015}

\begin{abstract}
	Playing with integer equations is really nice. This paper is a ... hmmm ... demonstration of an old adage \emph{if you don't practice mathematics for a long time, it's hard to come back to it}. Even when listening cool jazz from \emph{Lee Konitz}. At least, I played with \LaTeX\ and \emph{gcc}.

	At first, I wanted to find an algorithm to find integers which verify $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 1000^2.a + 1000.b + c$ with $a, b, c \in [0, 1000[$. There is an obvious lazy algorithm which tries every values of $a$, $b$ and $c$ in the range $[0, 1000[$. I wanted a clever one, not sure I found it, but read.
